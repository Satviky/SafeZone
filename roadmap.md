# 🛤️ Roadmap – SafeZone

A powerful safety companion designed for real-life urgency and calm recovery.
I personally want to make it... 
the environment... it well deserved... and so I will be starting with it
as soon as I am done with current one because I want to build it with full 
focus of mine so it turns out to be best.

## ✅ Phase 1 – Core Safety
- Set up React Native project with navigation
- Create main SOS button screen
- On SOS trigger:
  - Send location to emergency contacts
  - Optional live audio recording
- Offline fallback if network is weak

## 🌍 Phase 2 – Location & Response Features
- Show nearby police stations or trusted zones
- Quick chat with verified helpers (anonymized)
- Auto-message templates for family/friends

## 🧘 Phase 3 – Calming Tools
- Breathing mode
- Grounding technique steps
- Gentle sounds or visuals (e.g., waves, rain)

## ✨ Phase 4 – User Control & Expansion
- Add contact editing and emergency message config
- Panic shake or hidden trigger feature
- Explore secure cloud sync

> Built not just for emergency—but also for healing. 🌷
